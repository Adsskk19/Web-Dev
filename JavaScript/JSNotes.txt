JAVASCRIPT:
-----------
For-> control i, break, continue, when u know start & end.

foreach -> when you wanted to do anything on each element in an array.
no break and no continue.

for in -> objects
loop throught the keys or values

for of ->
want to get cleaner than foreach then we go for for-of
break and continue we can use

Functions:
----------
if you want to reuse set of instructions we use functions.

Hoisting:
-----------
// console.log(a)
// var a =10; //undefined
Two Concepts in Programming Language:
-------------------------------------
